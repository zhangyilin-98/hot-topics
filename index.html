						Most economists are in agreement that the inflation in the United States during the past three
						years has been the worst since the early 1940′s, taking account of both severity and duration.
						But they cannot agree on the nature of the inflation that is engulfing the American economy. To
						some, inflation denotes a spectacular rise in consumer prices; to others, an excessive
						aggregate demand; and to at least one economist, it is the creation of new money by our
						monetary authorities.This disagreement among economists is more than an academic difference on
						the meaning of a popular term. It reflects professional confusion as to the cause of the
						inflation problem and the policies that might help to correct it. A review of some basic
						principles of economics that are applicable to money may shed light on the problem.Two basic
						questions need to be answered: (1) What are the factors that originally afforded value to
						money, and (2) What are the factors that effect changes in the “objective exchange value of
						money” or its purchasing power?
						Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade in goods and services. Wherever people
						progressed beyond simple barter, they began to use their most marketable goods as media of
						exchange. In primitive societies they used cattle, or measures of grain, salt, or fish. In early
						civilizations where the division of labor extended to larger areas, gold or silver emerged as
						the most marketable good and finally as the only medium of exchange, called money. It is
						obvious that the chieftains, kings, and heads of state did not invent the use of money. But they
						frequently usurped control over it whenever they suffered budget deficits and could gain revenue
						from currency debasement.</p>
					<p>
						When an economic good is sought and wanted, not only for its use in consumption or production
						but also for purposes of exchange, to be held in reserve for later exchanges, the demand for it
						obviously increases. We may then speak of two partial demands which combine to raise its value
						in exchange—its purchasing power.

						<h4>Am I eating foods that come from GMO crops?</h4>
						It is very likely you are eating foods and food products that are made with ingredients that
						come
						from GMO crops. Many GMO crops are used to make ingredients that Americans eat such as
						cornstarch,
						corn syrup, corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil, or granulated sugar.  A few fresh fruits and
						vegetables are available in GMO varieties, including potatoes, summer squash, apples, and
						papayas.
						Although GMOs are in a lot of the foods we eat, most of the GMO crops grown in the United States
						are
						used for animal food.
						To make it easier for consumers to know if the foods they eat contain GMO ingredients, the U.S.
						Department of Agriculture maintains a <a href="javascript:void(0);">list of bioengineered
							foods</a> available throughout the world.
						Additionally, you will start seeing the “bioengineered” label on some of the foods we eat
						because of
						the new <a href="javascript:void(0);">National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard</a>. 
				
					<p>
						<h4>What <a href="javascript:void(0);">GMO crops</a> are grown and sold in the United States?
						</h4>
						<p>Only a few types of GMO crops are grown in the United States, but some of these GMOs make up
							a
							large percentage of the crop grown (e.g., soybeans, corn, sugar beets, canola, and cotton).
						</p>
						<p>
							In  <a href="javascript:void(0);">2018</a>, GMO soybeans made up 94% of all soybeans
							planted,
							GMO cotton made up 94% of all cotton planted, and 92% of corn planted was GMO corn.
						</p>
						<p>
							In <a href="javascript:void(0);">2013</a>, GMO canola made up 95% of canola planted while
							GMO
							sugar beets made up 99.9% of all sugar beets harvested.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most GMO plants are used to make ingredients that are then used in other food products, for
							example, cornstarch made from GMO corn or sugar made from GMO sugar beets.

						1.The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line,
						accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to
						download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our
						Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces,
						translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we
						are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The
						Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the
						glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of
						Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great
						works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like
						diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate readouts of their heart rate,
						insulin levels, and other important conditions within their own bodies. </p>

					<p>2.Computers will disappear, as will cellphones, clocks, watches, and MP3 players. Chips, costing
						less than a penny apiece, will be hidden by the millions in the environment. We will be able to
						command these hidden computers telepathically, directly via the mind. Computers will interpret
						the electrical signals emitted by our brains, decipher them, and carry out our wishes. When we
						walk into a room, we will be able to mentally control a computer that in turn will direct the
						many things around us. Moving heavy furniture, rearranging desks, and brewing a cup of coffee
						may be possible just by thinking about it. So we will be like the gods of mythology, mentally
						manipulating the world around us. We will also be able to conjure up almost any object just by
						wishing for it. This is done via “programmable matter,” which consists of millions of
						microscopic computer chips, which are intelligent and can be programmed to suddenly rearrange
						themselves into any shape or object on command, so that we will be able to create almost
						anything we can imagine (this is very similar to the Replicator from “Star Trek”).</p>
					<p>
						3.Our cars will be driver-less, using GPS to navigate without the help of an alert human behind
						the wheel. These cars will also fly (finally!) by floating on a cushion of magnetism. With
						room-temperature superconducting magnets, our cars and trains will glide effortlessly in the air
						without bumps or potholes to worry about since the crafts hover over the treacherous road.
						Traffic jams and accidents will be a thing of the past as a central computer will be able to
						track the motions of all the cars on the road (or air), while each car will use radar in its
						fenders to sense obstacles and take emergency measures as soon as it senses an impending
						accident. Best of all, we will hardly ever need to fuel up, since there is almost no friction to
						slow us down. This will also solve the energy crisis, since most energy is wasted, strangely
						enough, on overcoming the friction of the road. </p>
